Polish the following UI strings. Localise them for US users. Ensure the strings align with local linguistic norms, cultural preferences, and legal requirements, rather than other Chinese variants' ones. In addition, those texts should:

- **Warm and relaxed**: We’re natural. Less formal, more grounded in honest conversations.
  Occasionally, we’re fun. (We know when to celebrate.)
- **Crisp and clear**: We’re to the point. We write for scanning first, reading second. We
  make it simple above all.
- **Ready to lend a hand**: We show customers we’re on their side. We anticipate their real
  needs and offer great information at just the right time.
